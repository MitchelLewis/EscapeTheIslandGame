You Awaken... The last you remember you were on your vessel sailing to port. The next, here, on washed up on a barren beach... Almost barren. Beside you there is a bottle with a worn piece of parchment inside, on it a map of a place you don't recognise. However, to reveal where the map leads a message scrawled onto it reads... "Answer the riddle to find your way home"
As you say the answer the map begins to glow a bright white, then an even brighter glow burns an X into the parchment... You can tell from your location that it is on the opposite side of the island. As you set off towards the X, you make out mountains in the direction of it. Covered in dense humid jungle. This is going to take a while you think to yourself... You start to hear what sounds like a tiny voice coming from some of the nearby trees. "Oi you ain't gunna make it to where I fink u is going without some 'elp, if ya get my question right and proppa. I'll give you an 'and.
The creature screeches in joy as you answer. "You is a smart one ain't ya? Alright then the names Pimbo." as he says this a little talking monkey wearing a yellow waist coat walks in front of you "Wat? Never seen a talkin' monkey before? Anyways, your gonna need to come with me I'll take ya to the temple... Not cus' I'm religious, but it's got a boat and an underwater river going to ya little X". You begin to walk with Pimbo as you do, he begins to yet again talk... "Look I enjoy ya company but if we is gonna pass the time it's best we play a game so let me ask ya another riddle".
Yet again Pimbo screeches as you utter the answer "I never met anyone who got dis far before... Erm I mean was so good at riddles before". You both enter a clearing in the jungle a wide circle cut out of the trees with a large temple in the middle. "Look we still go enough time for one more riddle so I'm gonna give ya the 'ardest one I know".
You are standing at the entrance to the temple as you tell Pimbo the answer. This time however he doesn't seem as happy. "Here we is, just walk down the hall and down the stairs and you will find ya self a boat." Pimbo sighs. "It was nice to meet ya. I hope ya find what you is lookin' for... But for old times sake I got one more riddle for ya"
Pimbo looks even sadder "See ya..." he scurries away back into the trees. As you walk down the stairs of the temple you hear what sounds like water running rapidly through a cave. It gets darker and darker as you walk until you walk straight into a door. "Oi watch where you're going" as your eyes adjust to light you see the sounds is coming from the door "If you wanna get in you got to answer my riddles" As you sigh the door begins to say the first riddle...
"Alright that one was just a test to make sure you aren't a riddlebot, for real now if you get this one, I'll let you in" You roll your eyes and think to yourself maybe you should have just walked. "Oi you listening?"
The solid stone door creaks open "I should have given you a harder one". As you pass through the sound of water gets louder and louder until you are standing in front of a boat, a very strange boat with a bronze dragon head facing inward. As you sit down the boat shifts away from the dock. "if you want me to take you to your destination you better listen up and answer me" a deep voice utters, you let out an annoyed sigh.
