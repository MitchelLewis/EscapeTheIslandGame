You Awaken... The last you remember you were on your vessel sailing to port. The next, here, on washed up on a barren beach... Almost barren. Beside you there is a bottle with a worn piece of parchment inside, on it a map of a place you don't recognise. However, to reveal where the map leads a message scrawled onto it reads... "Answer the riddle to find your way home"
As you say the answer the map begins to glow a bright white, then an even brighter glow burns an X into the parchment... You can tell from your location that it is on the opposite side of the island. As you set off towards the X, you make out mountains in the direction of it. Covered in dense humid jungle. This is going to take a while you think to yourself... You start to hear what sounds like a tiny voice coming from some of the nearby trees. "Oi you ain't gunna make it to where I fink u is going without some 'elp, if ya get my question right and proppa. I'll give you an 'and.
The creature screeches in joy as you answer. "You is a smart one ain't ya? Alright then the names Pimbo." as he says this a little talking monkey wearing a yellow waist coat walks in front of you "Wat? Never seen a talkin' monkey before? Anyways, your gonna need to come with me I'll take ya to the temple... Not cus' I'm religious, but it's got a boat and an underwater river going to ya little X". You begin to walk with Pimbo as you do, he begins to yet again talk... "Look I enjoy ya company but if we is gonna pass the time it's best we play a game so let me ask ya another riddle".
Yet again Pimbo screeches as you utter the answer "I never met anyone who got dis far before... Erm I mean was so good at riddles before". You both enter a clearing in the jungle a wide circle cut out of the trees with a large temple in the middle. "Look we still go enough time for one more riddle so I'm gonna give ya the 'ardest one I know".
You are standing at the entrance to the temple as you tell Pimbo the answer. This time however he doesn't seem as happy. "Here we is, just walk down the hall and down the stairs and you will find ya self a boat." Pimbo sighs. "It was nice to meet ya. I hope ya find what you is lookin' for... But for old times sake I got one more riddle for ya"
Pimbo looks even sadder "See ya..." he scurries away back into the trees. As you walk down the stairs of the temple you hear what sounds like water running rapidly through a cave. It gets darker and darker as you walk until you walk straight into a door. "Oi watch where you're going" as your eyes adjust to light you see the sounds is coming from the door "If you wanna get in you got to answer my riddles" As you sigh the door begins to say the first riddle...
"Alright that one was just a test to make sure you aren't a riddlebot, for real now if you get this one, I'll let you in" You roll your eyes and think to yourself maybe you should have just walked. "Oi you listening?"
The solid stone door creaks open "I should have given you a harder one". As you pass through the sound of water gets louder and louder until you are standing in front of a boat, a very strange boat with a bronze dragon head facing inward. As you sit down the boat shifts away from the dock. "if you want me to take you to your destination you better listen up and answer me" a deep voice utters, you let out an annoyed sigh.
"Very well I can tell you have the map so I will sail to where you need, but I have more challenges for you" You notice the mouth on the dragon head moving with the voice, you quickly realise it is the dragon which is speak! "This is not a free trip, nor is it an easy one for me, I haven't spoken to anyone in a long time the last one was called limbo or something like that, so if you want me to keep this journey safe you better keep getting my questions right" the dragon begins to speak his next riddle...
"Ah well I guess you're smarter than you look, alright hold on tight this is going to be a rough ride". As you sail through the underground river you notice up ahead that it splits into two tunnels. "Looks like we have hit a crossroad, one of these tunnels will get you closer to that x on your map, the other further away. But I can help you to decide which one to choose, just make sure you answer this riddle correctly"...
"You are awfully eager to escape this island". The dragon boat goes through the tunnel on the right. Finally, you can see light up ahead, but you soon realise that the river ends where that light is. "Sorry to break it to you but we're approaching a waterfall, don't fret because this boat isn't just any boat". If you don't want to fall to your doom you must solve this riddle...
"Well done, you might just survive this island". As you approach the river and think that the boat is about to drop off the edge, bronze wings are released from the sides of the boat. You realise that the dragon boat is flying in the air. You can see part of the island as you fly, "Majestic isn't it?". Finally, the dragon boat lands on a clearing in front of another temple. "This is where I leave you as I am bound to this island but since you're so good at riddles try and solve this one"...
"I almost though you were going to get that wrong! Well dear fried I wish you the best of luck on this island. You'll need it!" As the dragon boat flies of, you see something small and yellow making its way towards you. It's Pimbo! " 'Ello matey, since you're so close to the end of your journey I thought I'd come and 'elp ya!". Pimbo Leads you through to the temple. "Tell ya what it is pitch dark in this temple! Maybe if you answer this riddle, we'll  get some light"...
Soon after you answer the riddle, flames appear on the torches against the temple wall lighting up a path for you. "It worked! Come on follow me mate".  As you walk through the temple you reach a great ancient looking door with no handle. "I think you know the drill by now" says Pimbo, to which you roll your eyes, "solve this riddle and this door will open for ya"....
"Open sesame!" The ancient looking door opens up to a large circular room. You notice a circular pattern in the middle of the room. "Hmm I'm sure there was a round table in here right above that circular pattern in the middle of this room, where in the world has it gone? How about you answer this riddle for me, and we see what happens" ...
Pimbo nods and smiles, "You're too good at this mate". The floor of the room starts to shake and rumble, and then you notice a hole start to appear right above the circular pattern in the middle of the room. All of a sudden something starts to rise out of the hole, "ah there's the table", Pimbo says as the room finally stops shaking. A glass cylinder pops out from the middle of the table and there inside is a glowing cube. "So that glowing cube is your exit of this island, answer this riddle and the cube will be released"
"Well done, go get the cube but 'andle it carefully". The top of the cylinder opens, and the cube levitates out of the cylinder. You hesitate but then reach out your hand to grab it. As you hold the cube it glows even brighter. "I guess you're wondering what now? But I just thought of a great riddle, lets see if you can solve it ey!" You let out and frustrated sigh but give your answer... 
"Ay you answered that riddle correctly which means you're almost there. Remember how I said the cube is your ticket off this island, well that's because the cube can turn into a portal that will transport you to wherever you want to go". You suddenly get excited, "Yes that means that you can finally escape. All you have to do is solve this next riddle! Make sure to stare into the cube as you give your answer"...
The cube flies out of your hand and rapidly spins the air and the suddenly a bright light flashes almost blinding you and Pimbo. Once you your eyes finally adjust you look across the room and see what looks like a glowing portal. You look through the portal and all you can see is darkness. "Now hold on friend, don't go stepping into that portal otherwise you'll find yourself in space or something. The portal has to be activated. You have to think about where you want to go and then of course answer this riddle correctly"...
The portal flashes and now through it you can see the sun shining in the blue sky and a house with a white fence around it. Its your house! "Excellent work, I must say friend I am going to miss you when you leave this island. I myself was just like you, a human being but I became cursed in this very temple and was turned into a monkey. Now I am bound to this island helping those that get stranded to escape. You have journeyed further than most. For old time sake answer this final riddle and then I promise you can escape..."
