You Awaken... The last you remember you were on your vessel sailing to port. The next, here, on washed up on a barren beach... Almost barren. Beside you there is a bottle with a worn piece of parchment inside, on it a map of a place you don't recognise. However, to reveal where the map leads a message scrawled onto it reads... "Answer the riddle to find your way home"@What has to be broken before you can use it?@An egg@Bacon and ...
As you say the answer the map begins to glow a bright white, then an even brighter glow burns an X into the parchment... You can tell from your location that it is on the opposite side of the island. As you set off towards the X, you make out mountains in the direction of it. Covered in dense humid jungle. This is going to take a while you think to yourself... You start to hear what sounds like a tiny voice coming from some of the nearby trees. "Oi you ain't gunna make it to where I fink u is going without some 'elp, if ya get my question right and proppa. I'll give you an 'and.@I'm tall when I'm young and I'm short when I'm old. What am I?@A candle@Burn it and smells nice
The creature screeches in joy as you answer. "You is a smart one ain't ya? Alright then the names Pimbo." as he says this a little talking monkey wearing a yellow waist coat walks in front of you "Wat? Never seen a talkin' monkey before? Anyways, your gonna need to come with me I'll take ya to the temple... Not cus' I'm religious, but it's got a boat and an underwater river going to ya little X". You begin to walk with Pimbo as you do, he begins to yet again talk... "Look I enjoy ya company but if we is gonna pass the time it's best we play a game so let me ask ya another riddle".@What month of the year has 28 days?@All of them@What months don't have 28 days?
Yet again Pimbo screeches as you utter the answer "I never met anyone who got dis far before... Erm I mean was so good at riddles before". You both enter a clearing in the jungle a wide circle cut out of the trees with a large temple in the middle. "Look we still go enough time for one more riddle so I'm gonna give ya the 'ardest one I know".@What is full of holes but still holds water?@A sponge@A cleaning device
